Hi there! I'm Luca, a full-stack developer with 10+ years of experience across various industries, ranging from startups to big companies such as Expedia, eBay, Elsevier, TransferWise, and Confluent. My passion lies in functional programming and clean, maintainable code, and I specialize in backend development, database management, and SQL. I'm proficient in languages such as Go, Scala, Java, Terraform, and JavaScript (with React).

In addition to my core skills, I also have extensive experience working with distributed systems and event-driven architectures. I'm well-versed in the challenges and compromises involved in designing scalable and fault-tolerant systems.

Throughout my career, I've been dedicated to delivering high-quality code that is easy to maintain and extend. I strive to write concise, expressive code that is easy to read and understand.
